`docker run --expose=3000 webdevwilson/tfwatch /var/lib/tfwatch`

## Planned Features

* Securely stores template variables
* Generates plans when changes committed to source
* Review and apply plans

## Developing

You can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/webdevwilson/tfwatch/releases) page.

### Backend

The backend is written using `go 1.8.1`. [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) is used for vendoring. To install the tools
you will need to develop on the backend, run `make tools`.

To run the backend with live reload run `fresh`. 

**You must have `$GOPATH/bin` on your `$PATH` for fresh to work**

### Frontend

Frontend vue.js app under NodeJS `v6.10.2`

To run the front end, run `npm run dev` from the `/site` directory. You will also need the backend running `go run main.go` to respond to API requests.

**NOTE: To run V2 of the site, run `npm run dev` from the `siteV2` directory**

### API Endpoints
